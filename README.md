# Command Line Interface Functional Framework

Do you want to have your Common Lisp app look at config files, the environment,
and command line to get your app's options, but don't want to have to actually
_code_ any of that stuff? Feel bogged down by writing the same old I/O code for
every app?

Then CLIFF is for you!

## Get it

CLIFF is on [ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl) and I'm trying to put it on
QuickLisp. Otherwise, just clone it to your local QuickLisp/ASDF projects
directory :)

## Documentation

Documentation including installation, tutorials and reference can be found
